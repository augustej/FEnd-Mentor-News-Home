## Overview

### The challenge
- Challenge included examples of 1440px and 375px width screens
- I did not use Pro account features (no Figma, most of design margins/font-size was my best guess)

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I have practised CSS grid, which is always a challenge, since I am more into flexbox.
- How to center an item among horizontal and vertical axis without flex/grid, if I have height of it. 
    .centered-item-css{
      position:absolute;
      top: calc((100vh - {height})/2);
      right:0;
      left:0;
      margin:0 auto;
    }
- Practised burger menu (display/hide elements)

### Continued development

The best way to learn is to practise. I wish to continue learning CSS grid in more complex challenges.
